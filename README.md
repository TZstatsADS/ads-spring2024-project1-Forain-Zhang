### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: What is the current trend for gaining happiness? Is it same across demographics?
+ This project is conducted by Forain Zhang

+ Project summary: Understanding the constituents of happiness has long been a pursuit in psychological and social research. This project utilizes the HappyDB corpus—a large collection of self-reported happy moments—to dissect and analyze the language of joy and satisfaction. Employing natural language processing techniques such as word clouds and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and k-means clusterings, alongside demographic analysis, we seek to unravel the themes and patterns that underpin expressions of happiness. Our findings illuminate a significant emphasis on social bonds, with words like "family," "friends," and "home" dominating the discourse. Furthermore, demographic insights reveal a variation in the sources of happiness across different age groups and between genders, reflecting a complex interplay between societal roles and personal experiences. Through a detailed examination of textual data, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of how happiness is articulated and experienced across diverse spectra of life, offering valuable perspectives for future research and applications in the field of positive psychology.

+ Questions will be answered:

1. What are the current trend for happiness by keywords
2. Any difference of trend across demographics such as age and gender
3. What are the main categories of those happiness
