### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Project title: 
+ This project is conducted by Forain Zhang

+ Project summary: In the quest to understand the nuances of human happiness, text data analysis provides a unique lens through which to see the myriad ways in which people express their moments of joy. This project utilizes a rich dataset from HappyDB to delve into the core of how people describe happy moments using advanced text analytics and demographic analysis. By creating word clouds, exploring demographic distributions, and applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and k-means clustering, we embarked on a journey to reveal the themes and patterns of happiness resonance across different age groups, genders, and social roles. Our goal is not only to map the expression of happiness but also to reveal the underlying currents that shape our perception and experience of joy.
